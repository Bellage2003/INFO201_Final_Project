# INFO201_Final_Project

## Domain of Interest: Mental Health
### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
Our group is interested in the mental health domain because as college students, people our age and younger are often severely affected by mental health and/or suicide.
### What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain?
1. Suicide Rates
2. Happiness Level Surveys (calculated by scale such as 1-10)
3. Percentage of Americans who are clinically diagnosed with depression
### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?
1. How does technology affect happiness/state of mental health?
2. In what groups and/or areas is suicide most prevalent?
3. Amid COVID-19, how have people's mental health been affected?

## Finding Data
### World Happiness Report
1. I downloaded the data from the Kaggle website, which is as .csv document format.

2. The data was collected from The World Happiness Report, a report that ranks 155 different countries based on their happiness levels via survey. The World Happiness Report gained popularity after it was released by the United Nations in 2017 at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness of March 20th.

3. There are 157 rows in this dataset.

4. There are 9 columns in this dataset.

5. This data can help answer our second data-driven question by giving us insight on how happy people are across varying countries. It will be useful to use RStudio to further filter groups based on location and level of happiness.

### Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016
1. I downloaded the data from the Kaggle website, which is a .csv document format. 

2. The data was collected from different references, such as World Health Organization and World Bank, by Kaggle's publisher who named Rusty. The data is about the rates of suicide in different years in different countries.

3. There are 27821 rows in this dataset.

4. There are 12 columns in this dataset.

5. The second question in the above data-driven questions can be answered since there are different gender groups, age groups, and countries in the dataset. It is easy to use RStudio to identify or filter the most prevalent suicide group or even area. 

### Mental Health in Tech
1. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle website, which is a .csv doument format.

2. The data was collected from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. The owner of this dataset is Open Souring Mental Illness, LTD. And this dataset was updated by Esther Kim, data intern at Kaggle.

3. There are 1259 rows in this dataset.

4. There are 27 columns in this dataset.

5. This dataset can answer how the tech workplace influence on people's mental health and mental health disorders. Thus, this dataset will help us answer our first data-driven question shown above.
